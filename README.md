# SC-ODIN Flight Software (FSW)

Space Concordia’s Orbital Dust Imaging Nanosatellite (SC-ODIN) is a 3U CubeSat that seeks to capture imaging data over Canada, Lake Colhué Huapí in Argentina, and Namibian coastal regions to characterize the aerosol particles that are present in the dust storms which frequent these locations. The images will be transmitted back to Earth for processing with the goal of extracting aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from the dust storm particles.These AOD measurements will be used by climate scientists at the University of Montreal to update their climate models.

SC-ODIN is Concordia's participant in the Canadian Space Agency’s CubeSat Project (CCP) as one of 15 schools from across Canada selected to design, build, and launch a novel mission into space. Space Concordia's entry into the project entered development in summer 2018. The satellite is designed and built by university students representing every faculty at Concordia, in partnership with the University of Montreal and the Gina Cody School of Engineering & Computer Science. 

# Flight Software Framework

SC-ODIN has chosen [Fprime](https://github.com/nasa/fprime) as its Flight Software Framework because it offers many features that allow for rapid development and deployment. It is a component-driven framework developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and has been already deployed on several space missions. If the reader wants to learn more about this awesome framework, we recommend going directly to the [Fprime repo](https://github.com/nasa/fprime) or to our online [guide](https://docs.sc-odin.now.sh/#/fprime-guide/index).
